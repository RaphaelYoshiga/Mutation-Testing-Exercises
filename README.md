# Mutation-Testing-Exercises

A set of simple exercises for practising manual mutation testing.

## How to use these exercises:

Each exercise contains a small code sample and some tests.

There are gaps in the code coverage. Your challenge is to identify these gaps by making small changes to the implementation code, creating a mutant. If at least one test fails, then you have trapped the mutant; if all the tests still pass, then the mutant lives, and you have found a gap in code coverage.

## Bonus points

I have hidden some classic design patterns in the code samples. Bonus points—redeemable for extra glory—will be awarded if you can spot them.
